    <p>Currently, our membership consists of 1111 certified EMTs and 2222 <a href="/join-mcems/">training corps</a> members. We operate as a Pennsylvania Department of Health certified Basic Life Support Quick Response Service, which means that we arrive on scene quickly, stabilize the patient, and prepare them for transport to a hospital by ambulance (if needed).</p>
