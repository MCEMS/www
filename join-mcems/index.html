    <h1>Training Corps</h1>
    <p>In 2014, MCEMS began a Training Corps program in which students who are not yet certified EMTs can join the organization, ride along on calls, and learn about EMS before committing to taking a class.</p>

    <p>Overall, the results of the program have been outstanding &mdash; some of our most dedicated EMTs have come through this program. If you're interested in becoming an EMT but aren't sure if it's for you, joining the training corps could be a good place to start.</p>
    <p>Members of the training corps ride scheduled shifts as observers along with certified EMTs, and participate in the same training excercises.</p>

    <p>To become a Pennsylvania DOH certified Emergency Medical Technician, you must take a course that consists of classroom lectures and hands-on skills sessions. At the conclusion, you must sit for the certification exam.</p>
    <p>The Lehigh Valley Health Network's <a href="http://emi-lvh.net/">George E Moerkirk Emergency Medicine Institute</a>, located in Allentown, offers EMT courses generally each semester in conjunction with <a href="http://publicsafety.lccc.edu/">Lehigh Carbon Community College</a>.</p>
    <p>If you'd rather take a class at home during the summer, we can help you find one nearby. Just reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@bergems.org">info@bergems.org</a>.</p>
