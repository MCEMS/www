    <p class="lead">Muhlenberg College EMS provides quick response Basic Life Support to the campus community</p>
    <p>We are a student-run, volunteer EMS organization serving our campus of approximately 2400 students. We operate 24 hours a day everyday the college is in session.</p>
    <p>Currently, our membership consists of {{ site.data.membership.emt }} certified EMTs and {{ site.data.membership.training_corps }} <a href="/join-mcems/">training corps</a> members. We operate as a Pennsylvania Department of Health certified Basic Life Support Quick Response Service, which means that we arrive on scene quickly, stabilize the patient, and prepare them for transport to a hospital by ambulance (if needed).</p>

    <h1>Our Vehicle</h1>
    <p>As a quick response service, we operate a Ford SUV that carries almost everything that would be found in a BLS ambulance. This includes a "first in" bag with oxygen supplies, bandages, splints, airways, various size blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes, and more.</p>
    <p>We also carry a backboard to restrict spinal movement in patients with suspected spinal injuries, a stair chair, personal protective equipment, Epi-Pens, and much more. <a href="/apparatus/">Learn more about our apparatus</a>.</p>
